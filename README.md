# React Color Dropdown

We provided some simple React template code. Your goal is to create a dropdown (select element) with options for Red, Blue, and Green colors. When a user selects a color, a message should appear below the dropdown. This message should display the currently selected color in the format: "You have selected: [Color]". The initial color displayed should be Red.
